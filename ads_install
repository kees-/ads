a[0]="To complete the setup process, \033[1mads\033[0;43;103m needs to copy the default config library somewhere with easier access."
a[1]="The program requires you to fill in a few options before use."
a[2]="The most important thing you need to publish any creations is: shell access to a hosted web server."
a[3]="It is also the most complex thing necessary to use the program in full, so it can seem inaccessible for those who have not done web work."
a[4]="The program is designed to have a very low and portable footprint! You do not need your own home server or access to something you registered. You are highly recommended to freeload in a corner of a trusted friend's server."
a[5]="In such an instance you only have to ask them to help you set a few specific credentials."
a[6]="The first value is where you want to locally store the structure of what you make."
a[7]="It should be somewhere stable and easy to access."
a[8]="You can change this later to relocate or begin a new instance."
a[9]="In addition to directories for config and holding your project(s), the final local location you must specify is for outputting media you encode."
a[10]="This is a intermediate workshop space to create and store unstructured files, as opposed to the more stable directories the program points to."
a[11]="Make it as simple as your desktop or anywhere else convenient."
a[12]="Here is where you need your username and hostname to the web server you are choosing to use."
a[13]="These will be as simple as \"name\" and \"example.com\" or similar."
a[14]="You do not have to enter them now, but you will not be able to access the upload utility or publish any sites until you do."
a[15]="You need to define a file path from the root of your chosen web server to the location you will use as a base for the published project."
a[16]="Entering this path properly is crucial but can be confusing for newcomers."
a[17]="It is specific to the actual file structure of the server, which browsing users lack access to."
a[18]="If you already have shell access to a server, you can guide yourself by typing in a command like \033[1mssh name@host.site ls\033[0;43;103m, which lists your files relative to the root."
a[19]="The path you type will start from one of the directories listed, chosen at your discretion."
a[20]="For example, \033[4mpublic_html/path_to/dir/\033[0;43;103m or \033[4mmy.sub.domain/path/project/1/\033[0;43;103m or any variant that leads to something web-accessible. Seek help if you are still uncertain."
a[21]="You need to enter the full URL to where the base of your site will be located online."
a[22]="It will have some correspondence with the other config options. Example: if your host is \033[4mmyweb.site\033[0;43;103m and root upload path is \033[4mpublic_html/tree/\033[0;43;103m the site could be \033[4mhttps://myweb.site/tree/\033[0;43;103m"
a[23]="The URL does need to be the homepage or even contain content. All the pages just branch out from here."
a[24]="Include the URL prefix."
a[25]="Please note, this install script is truly SICKENING!! A future release will hopefully make for significant streamlining."
a[26]="Example: \033[4m${HOME}/projects/my_ads/\033[0;43;103m"
a[27]="It seems like you have already installed ads. All the settings configured in this script can be changed in-program."
a[28]="It is recommended to check the settings in the program to make sure it is configured properly."
