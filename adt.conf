a[0]="Here you are able to change basic settings to ease use of the program. Other than remapping keys to each utility, most options should not need changing after setup. Adjusting strings can be very destructive as the program already runs precariously."
a[1]="An exception is changing local and remote directory locations/web credentials when you want to create more sites."
a[2]="You activated baby mode. The program will now display significantly more helptext and tips for usage (highlighted)."
a[3]="Baby mode is recommended for new users, those unfamiliar running software from the command line, those new to web hosting, etc."
a[4]="Regular mode displays certain important guidelines for each tool. Expert mode disables all but basic usage prompts."
a[5]="The username and hostname are what the program uses each time you upload or sync the web structure you create locally, onto the public internet."
a[6]="The base URL is only the main web location your site structure branches out from. It can be, but is not necessarily its homepage. The pages of your sites can start or end anywhere, depending on how you choose to link to them."
a[7]="Here you can adjust various options. Select a number to see more."
a[8]="This is the webpage title users see online on the otherwise completely blank pages, which hide the contents of a directory from public access."
a[9]="The default webpage title of all other pages is an unfilled checkbox."
a[10]="This defines the path relative to the SSH root folder and leading to where your current ADS site is maintained."
a[11]="The precise file structure depends on how and where your web server is maintained. Ensure this path is accurate. Ask a friend, use trial and error. You do not want to run the upload utility in the wrong place. Doing so can result in remote file loss."
a[12]="This is the partial filename of each template used for certain HTML pages generated by the program."
a[13]="Do not change unless you have already adjusted each filename accordingly, contained in the template subdirectory where you placed your config."
a[14]="For these templates, which exist in a set, do not remove the numerical filename prefixes."
a[15]="This is the filename of a template used for certain HTML pages generated by the program."
a[16]="This is the absolute path to where the full local copy of your current site is generated and stored. In other words, here is where most of the file manipulation you perform with this program takes place. Many paths you input during normal use of the program are typed relative to this directory, so keep it handy and stable."
a[17]="Consider this (absolute) path the workshop folder you actively interact with when encoding gifs. Gifs are placed here, then you can store there or elsewhere until you transfer them to your web folder with the program. For the general user this could be your desktop or another convenient folder you designate."
a[18]="You define this absolute directory on setup and have little reason to adjust it. It contains all the configuration and resources the program needs to operate. Note the program foundationally requires all files in this directory and is not intelligent enough to find them on its own."
a[19]="General good practice would be to use the default location, .config/ads in your user home folder."
a[20]="Here you adjust the general purpose buttons you press to call the program's functions. Capitals, lowercase, and numbers are accepted."
a[21]="One caveat is the quit key is prevented from conflicting globally, including to the miscellanous keybindings."
a[22]="Here you adjust the buttons of certain additional functions, accessing the settings and switching modes. Capitals, lowercase, and numbers are accepted."
a[23]="Retrying will automatically select the most recent function and attempt to autofill with your last input, for easier adjustments."
a[24]="Here is the condensed list of pending uploads, which will update all included changes made locally to be reflected publicly online."
a[25]="You cannot manually add to the queue but can input lists of any locations to sync with the upload utility itself."
a[26]="Nothing you create with the program will be accessible online until you run this utility to make your sites public. The program facilitates your local work, and when you are ready, the upload function acts as a post or publish button, or a (versionless) commit. It acts on the exact scope you input, for precise control, changing only necessary files."
a[27]="If you have an active queue when quitting, you have the option to save its items for the next session."
a[28]="Important: removing local files then synchronizing with your web server will also remove matching files hosted remotely. Use the upload utility to remove access to any files. Bear in mind this is reason to keep your local file structure as stable as possible."
a[29]="Tip: manually entering a period or forward slash as an argument will synchronize the entire local web directory from its base. This is a good option for a large sweep to catch changes or publish a lot of material. It should only have unintended consequences if you have moved files locally, resulting in inaccessible content or broken links."
a[30]="The program will display basic information pertaining to what files you added, removed, or updated. It should also throw some basic error messages if there is a problem. Problems likely arise because of issues with configuration, server permissions, bad logins, internet access and such."
a[31]="Here are web-related options configuring how and where you publish your sites publicly. Select a number to see more."
a[32]="If all uploads were successful, clearing your pending queue is recommended to avoid redundancy. If you have other reasons to redo, view, save your current queue, you have the option."
a[33]="Blank input (no arguments) returns to main menu."
a[34]="With this you remove the links created in-program that connect pages. Your sites can be straightforward as a static linear display, the worst shifting labyrinth, or anything. Removing links lets you cut off sections by access point or rearrange how browsing users navigate."
a[35]="Note: this tool only disables connections and does not remove pages. No automatic tool is included to fully do so. The principle of the program is regulate average users' access through links, but retain direct URL access with inquisitive searching, pattern recognition, etc. You can of course remove anything manually."
a[36]="Tip: this tool will work on internal cap pages. It disables/reenables click access to the direct image, provided the path you input targets the precise HTML file by name."
a[37]="Escaping spaces means including one backslash before each space character in all paths and the names of files."
a[38]="Some servers allow access to file structures in directories that lack a web page file. If this is so you can quickly stop users from seeing lists of files and subdirectories page by page. This tool creates empty files to display a blank screen at individual URL destinations. These are never intended to be linked to or interacted with."
a[39]="For a more systematic option web admins can disable directory access globally or often per branch. The only downside is directories without content will then tend to throw 403 forbidden errors. Blinder pages are intended to be as basic an elegant solution as possible."
a[40]="If you have created cap pages, pointing this tool to their parent linking page allows two options. You can expunge the link completely (removing display page if possible), or disable the link, displaying the text marked with EXPIRED."
a[41]="The latter retains internal cap pages, still accessible by exact URL, but inaccessible by browsing."
a[42]="Displaying expired cap titles can be functional, e.g. broken outbound links, or stylistic for any reason."
a[43]="Use this tool to add and maintain particular outbound pages. The program allows you to create a list of text hyperlinks each called a CAP."
a[44]="You may either generate a sub-page which displays a single embedded image in any basic format, or have the link point to any valid web URL."
a[45]="The links accumulate below the main content on any gif display page. This utility is only designed to manage caps on such pages generated in-program."
a[46]="Organized image hosting is not managed in-program at this time. Images can be embedded from anywhere online. To self-host, upload manually with included utility or externally."
a[47]="You can optionally display a date as text, or feasibly any other message, in the format Date | Title. The date is displayed only on the cap page and not where it is linked from."
a[48]="The page connector adds a hyperlink to the gif of your choice on a display page, making any image clickable. As with the basic interactive internet, navigating across pages as you create them is the foundation of the user experience."
a[49]="In-program, all links you add point to pages within the scope of your current project directory. Standard use involves typing in the directories you want to connect and allowing the program to handle making content web-ready as you configured it."
a[50]="You add links one at a time. The selected page displays a layout with more than one gif, so you can make a variety of connections here. This feature is the source of nonlinearity within the program."
a[51]="Once you have encoded gifs, you will see they output and accumulate where you chose during setup. This tool will relocate and organize any gifs you specify into your current site directory."
a[52]="Included is a feature that, if called, renames files by a simple convention as they are moved. Each file is given a unique per folder two-character name in descending alphabetical order."
a[53]="Note: by a quirk, some web hosts block the display of files called 'ad.gif' on their servers. This is the fourth filename of the naming convention. To maintain the greatest usability, the program always skips 'ad' when renaming files."
a[54]="Each individual folder has capacity for 675 (26^2-1) renamed gifs and unlimited gifs with custom names."
a[55]="You never need to manually create particular folders when typing nonexistent subdirectories into the program."
a[56]="Without particular reason otherwise, it is recommended to add the directory containing the file(s) you operated on to the queue, which can be sent to upload at any time."
a[57]="This tool creates the most recurring building block of your sites. It encodes one very small gif, of rigid size and aspect ratio, from any media file you choose to input."
a[58]="Selection is your greatest ongoing expanse of creativity moving from a body of media files at start, to a branching public website without an end."
a[59]="You are intended to use any and all video files, and can slice as long or short a clip as desired. Still images can also be handled without issue."
a[60]="The encoder is robust and so the program can be given essentially any viewable media. It is all fit to a small frame."
a[61]="Tip: the encoding can be slow for very large files, even in extracting short clips. Be advised, with files as long or large files such as movies, to fist reencode portions using your preferred program (e.g., Handbrake)."
a[62]="Creating gifs is the first mechanic in the central pipeline during use of the program. Subsequently, you will tend to organize your gifs, then create web-ready displays for them with the page generators."
a[63]="Tip: the program makes no effort to monitor file sizes. It is up to the user to mind what they create for reasonable web hosting down the line."
a[64]="The standard functions to call in sequence after ${k[makemini]#*:} are ${k[mvgifs]#*:} and then ${k[makeminispage]#*:}."
a[65]="This tool creates the secondary building block for your sites, a larger and variable sized gif. It is encoded from any media file chosen for input."
a[66]="These gifs are not restricted to a specific filesize. For layout compatibility they are intended to display by themselves on a page. The standard functions to call in sequence after ${k[makelink]#*:} are then ${k[mvgifs]#*:} and ${k[makelinkpage]#*:}, to generate a 1x1 layout."
a[67]="After creating and preparing gifs, this tool places your selections into autogenerated webpages."
a[68]="The current tool handles specifically the mini gifs of uniform size. You create a grid with any combination of width and height above 1x1, up to 4x4."
a[69]="Currently, all gifs per page must be contained in the same subdirectory."
a[70]="After compilation, assembly, and upload, the effect on each page will be a matrix of small frames playing bits of media in unison. How you arrange materials within the rigid layouts are entirely freeform: communication, a story you tell, anything, is all determined visually with the content."
a[71]="Now just type the file name prefixes of each gif you want to display in sequential order as shown in the diagram."
a[72]="After creating any pages, you can operate on them with ${k[connect]#*:} or ${k[capmgr]#*:}, or ${k[killcap]#*:} and ${k[remlnk]#*:} to undo the same processes."
a[73]="To commit any of these changes for public view, use ${k[upld]#*:} at any time during or after."
a[74]="It will create a simpler page compared to the other page generator, displaying only one centered gif."
a[75]="The embedded gif size can be variable, including even a single mini gif, but is intended for the larger gifs created by the corresponding encoder."
